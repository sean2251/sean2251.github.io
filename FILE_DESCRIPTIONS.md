# File Descriptions for sean2251.github.io

This document explains the purpose and function of each file in this repository.

## Overview
This is a Quarto-generated static website hosted on GitHub Pages. The repository contains the built HTML files and supporting assets that make up the published website.

## Root Files

### `index.html`
**Purpose:** The main homepage of the website.

**Description:** This is the primary landing page for the site. It contains:
- A welcome message stating "This is a Quarto website"
- A link to learn more about Quarto websites (https://quarto.org/docs/websites)
- The site's navigation structure with links to Home and About pages
- Quarto's built-in search functionality
- All necessary JavaScript and CSS references for site functionality

**Generated by:** Quarto from source `.qmd` or `.md` files (version 1.7.32)

---

### `about.html`
**Purpose:** The "About" page of the website.

**Description:** A secondary page accessible via the navigation menu. Currently contains:
- A page titled "About"
- Simple content stating "About this site"
- The same navigation structure and search functionality as the homepage
- Consistent styling and layout with the rest of the site

**Generated by:** Quarto from source `.qmd` or `.md` files

---

### `styles.css`
**Purpose:** Custom CSS stylesheet for the website.

**Description:** Contains custom CSS styles to override or supplement the default Quarto/Bootstrap styling. Currently minimal with only a comment `/* css styles */`, indicating that the site primarily uses default styles.

**Type:** CSS stylesheet (can be manually edited or generated by build process)

---

### `search.json`
**Purpose:** Search index for the website's built-in search functionality.

**Description:** A JSON file containing searchable content from all pages on the site. Includes:
- Page object IDs (e.g., "about.html", "index.html")
- Page URLs (href)
- Page titles
- Section information
- Text content from each page

This file is consumed by the Quarto search JavaScript to enable the search functionality in the navigation bar.

**Generated by:** Quarto during the build process

---

### `.nojekyll`
**Purpose:** Instructs GitHub Pages to bypass Jekyll processing.

**Description:** An empty marker file that tells GitHub Pages not to process the site with Jekyll (GitHub's default static site generator). This is necessary because:
- Quarto generates the site with its own processing
- Jekyll would interfere with files/folders starting with underscores
- The site should be served as-is without additional processing

**Type:** Marker file (empty file, just needs to exist)

---

## Directories

### `site_libs/`
**Purpose:** Contains all JavaScript libraries and CSS frameworks required by the website.

**Description:** A directory containing third-party libraries and frameworks used by Quarto-generated sites. Subdirectories include:

#### `site_libs/bootstrap/`

- **Contents:** Bootstrap CSS, JavaScript, and icon font files
- **Function:** Provides responsive layout, styling components, and UI elements

#### `site_libs/clipboard/`

- **Function:** Provides Quarto-specific features like syntax highlighting, tooltips, anchor links, and tabsets

#### `site_libs/quarto-nav/`
- **Purpose:** Navigation functionality
- **Contents:** JavaScript for navigation and Headroom.js

---

## Git-Specific Files

### `.git/`
**Purpose:** Git version control directory.

**Description:** Contains all Git repository data including:
